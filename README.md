*Short for "Run And Gun"* 
<br>
Custom deathmatch arena gamemode for the game Unturned 

## How it works
You spawn at the lobby, once there you can vote for an arena you'd like to fight in.
<br>
After the intermission and the voting period passes, all the players get teleported into the voted arena and the fun beings!
<br>
Everyone spawns with a random loadout in a random location in the arena. The First player to reach X amount of kills wins or if the timer runs out, the player with the most amount of kills in that round wins. 
<br>
If the match is already in progress, you will be automatically teleported into the match and will be ready to go!
